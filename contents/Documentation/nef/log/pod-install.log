Pod installation complete! There are 9 dependencies from the Podfile and 14 total pods installed.

[!] The Podfile contains framework or static library targets (Documentation), for which the Podfile does not contain host targets (targets which embed the framework).
If this project is for doing framework development, you can ignore this message. Otherwise, add a target to the Podfile that embeds these frameworks to make this message go away (e.g. a test target).
